To collect data from the mindflex and pair it with the "blink" or symptoms
programs, do the following:

1. cd neuro-game/neuro-collector
2. Start server: ./run_server
3. Start mindflex: sudo ./run_mindflex_client
4. Start blink client: ./run_blink_client
   or
   Start symptoms: ./run_symptoms_client

Remember, sudo password is "tampahack" on tampahack box



To change the mechanics of the symptoms client, open:

    neuro-game/neuro-collector/neuro_collector/clients/symptoms/__init__.py

To change how long the symptom and "do you experience" text stays on screen, edit:

    TIME_SYMPTOM_ON_SCREEN = 3000

To change how long "BLINK" stays on screen, edit:

    TIME_BLINK_ON_SCREEN = 500

To change how long the screen is blank between symptoms and "blink", edit:

    TIME_SCREEN_BLANK = 1000

All time is in milliseconds.
